This repository contains my personal portfolio website.
It is used to present my projects, skills, and current learning progress as a  
**Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung (IHK)** *(in training)*.

The portfolio is part of my preparation for the mandatory internship phase
and serves as a central place to showcase my work and technical development.
